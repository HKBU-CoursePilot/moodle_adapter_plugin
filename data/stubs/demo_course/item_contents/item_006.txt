Lecture 2: Control Flow
=======================

Topics Covered:
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Loops (for, while)
- Loop control (break, continue)

If Statements
-------------
if condition:
    # code block
elif another_condition:
    # code block
else:
    # code block

For Loops
---------
for item in sequence:
    # do something with item

Example:
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

While Loops

while condition:
    # code block

Example:
count = 0
while count < 5:
